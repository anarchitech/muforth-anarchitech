# Included Documentation

As the intended purpose of muforth is to function as a host for
tethering to various targets for the purpose of building Forth systems
on those targets or general exploration, we felt that including
manufacturer documentation in this repository would be A Good And
Beneficial Thing to the community.

**Under no circumstances should it be construed that we are usurping the
copyright of said documents**, and furthermore we feel strongly that their
inclusion both falls under the **doctrine of "Fair Use"** and benefits all
concerned.  If you are a manufacturer of one of those targets, feel free
to reach out, but take a moment to reflect that we're actually **helping
to promote and support your product** by developing for it in the first
place.

Documentation for supported targets, if available and included, may be
found in the following **subdirectories** of muforth/mu/target/
