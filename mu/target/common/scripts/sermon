# sermon : serial monitor.  Used primarily for monitoring muforth
# tasks code from a PL2303 hooked to tx/rx/gnd of the MSP430fr6989
# launchpad board. stty on OpenBSD does not work the same as on 
# Linux, and in order to successfully monitor a serial connection
# that enumerates to /dev/cuaUx, you must use either cu or serial
# monitor such as minicom.  cu is cleaner with less setup.
#
# Note that on OpenBSD serial devices such as the PL2303 will, in
# dmesg output (or xconsole), when they enumerate, list first their
# driver (uplcom0 in the case of the PL2303 if it's the first such
# device attached) and then the USB tty driver, ucomX, which will
# either point at a ttyUx device or a cuaUx device.
#
# For example, with the fr6989 plugged into one USB port and the
# PL2303 plugged into another, it enumerates as follows:
#
# uplcom0 at uhub1 port 1 configuration 1 interface 0 "Prolific
# Technology Inc. USB-Serial Controller" rev 1.10/3.00 addr 2
# ucom2 at uplcom0
#
# Hence, we would pass /dev/cuaU2 to cu.
#
# The options used are as follows:
#
#  -d    Specify that the line is directly connected and cu
#        should not allow the driver to block waiting for a 
#        carrier to be detected.
#
# -r     Start cu in restricted mode.  This prevents all local
#        filesystem operations (~R, ~X and ~>) and command
#        executions (~C and ~$).
#
# -l     Specify the line to use.  Either of the forms like
#        cua00 or /dev/cua00 are permitted.  The default is
#        /dev/cua00.  See cua(4) for information on terminal
#        devices. Users in group "dialer" are permitted to use
#        cua(4) devices by default.
#
# -s     speed | -speed
#        Set the speed of the conneciton. The default is 9600.
