*NB: The Bumblebee Core is a RISC-V core customized by Nuclei System
Technology and GigaDevice with the GD32VF103 core jointly developed by
Nuclei System Technology and Andes Technology.  The Bumblebee Core
documents are considered *obsolete* by Nuclei System Technology, but we
include them here to cross reference against the newer documentation. In
our experience, vendor supplied documentation can be a bit of a moving
target! 

Finally, the current *official* Nuclei ISA Specification version 2.0.3,
which is presumably Nuceli System Technology's own flavor of the RISC-V
ISA, may (insofar as we know) be only found online at:

Ping us if you know of a pdf for this document and we'll include it in
our archives!
