OpenBSD: FTDI is in a pretty dodgy state on OpenBSD.  Yes, libftdi1 is
available, yes, ftdi devices will enumerate, no, there is no guarantee
you will be able to successfully use them consistently as we've
discovered during a recent bout of testing.

Linux: FTDI devices so far, in fact the same FTDI devices which
universally failed during OpenBSD testing, worked OOTB.

It just depends on what you're doing with the device.  Serial chat with
a target and muforth? Fine on both OpenBSD and Linux.  Dump the
signature off an atmeg328p using a Tigard + the canonical harness with
avrdude? Linux: fine.  OpenBSD: good luck with that.

There's even "a trick" that you can use, one of my personal faves: lie
to the machine. And it sometimes works, depending on software/hardware
combo aimed at the ftdi device:

1) Unplug ftdi device and reboot
2) At 
        boot>
   type
        boot> boot -c
        UKC> disable ufdi
        UKC> quit
3) After it boots, plug in the device and note that it likely enumerates
as a /dev/ugenX device.  Cool. Try aiming at that.  Joy? Great, have at
it.  No joy?  This is why you have a Linux box. ;)
