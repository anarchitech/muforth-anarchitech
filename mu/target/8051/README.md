# muforth 8051 support

This is a WIP, initially targeting the Silicon Labs devices.

Development on this has been *fast*.  The 8051 is not an ideal
target for Forth, but muforth's usefulness extends beyond simply
creating Forth based systems on microcontroller targets.

For a quickstart on how to get this to work, [see this.](https://github.com/anarchitech/muforth-anarchitech/blob/master/mu/target/8051/silabs/efm8/README.txt)
