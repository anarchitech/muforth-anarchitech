============================================================
        First Steps, aka What The Fuck Do I Do Now?
============================================================

I have no idea how or why you got here.  Curiousity perhaps. Maybe you 
want to build something useful, like a control for a local irrigation
system, or hack an ECU because you're converting to ethanol, or fuck with 
John Deere because they're assholes ... whatever.

Keep in mind the following: computers are good for two basic things:

1) Crunching/manipulating lots of data really fucking fast
2) Controlling physical processes

Our focus is microcontrollers, which puts us squarely in the camp of
item 2 above, and the focus of *this* target directory is the 
venerable MSP430 family from Texas Instruments.

These damn things are literally everywhere: automotive, aircraft,
medical, toys ... yeah, so is STM, the 8051 and blah blah blah, but
ignore them while you're here.  The MSP430 is its own animal, as they
are theirs.

I'll be using the MSP430FR6989 Launchpad (MSP-EXP430FR6989) as an
example in this document, but the basic info applies to other members of
the family.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Don't panic.

There is lot to unpack here, and if you have no familiarity with
microcontrollers you are in for a bit of a rollercoaster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: RTFM.

A) Datasheet
B) User Manual

===================
   The Datasheet
===================

The first place to start after your overview and any other crawling
through the jumbled interwebs you decide to pursue to add to your
confusion is to Read The Datasheet.  Always Read The Datasheet.

You can find datasheets for a particular microcontroller via your
search engine of choice, but a word of caution: try to find the latest
current version.  99.99% of the time you should download these directly
from the manufacturers site.  Be wary of rando pdf's yanked from the
web.

We (anarchitech.org) try to keep copies of the current relevant docs
stashed in this repo, but hey man, the beer is free, so ...

At the very least, run any pdf's you grab through

  https://virustotal.com

and if you haven't heard about polyglots you would be wise to educate
yourself.

For the msp430fr6989, the datasheet may be found locally here:

           mu/target/MSP430/doc/msp430fr6989.pdf

WARNING: TI, like other manufacturers, has their own rather fucked up
naming convention for their documemtation.  I'm sure it makes sense on
their end, but as a general rule their document names convey no
intuitively obvious hint as to which device it's supposed to cover.
For example, the above doc internally is named

       SLAS789D.pdf

in TI land.  Helpful, right?  We try to rename the docs locally, as long
as it doesn't cause breakage in inter-doc linking ...  reminder again
that the beer is free.

The datasheet in this case is 183 pages long, but most of that you can,
on first read, say to yourself "blah blah blah" when confronted with
lots of exciting graphs and mundane (but eventually critical!) details.

Read Section 1.
Briefly take note of sections 2-3.
Scan Section 4.
Scroll quickly through Section 5 at this stage lest panic truly set in.
Read the text bits of Section 6 and scan the tables for familiarity.
Briefly acquaint yourself with Section 7.

Section 8 as useful information on further documentation, device support
and tooling if you decide "Fuck this Forth crap."  


=====================
   The User Manual
=====================

Great, next on your list of light reading is The User Manual.

Locally, that may be found here:

     mu/target/MSP430/doc/slau367o.pdf

Oh, look, a thoroughly obtuse TI name.  Yeah, you were warned.

Now, the User Manual is 1,021 pages long.  Please remain calm. You do
not need to memorize this damn thing.  You are going to eat the element
one byte at a time. (Yes I did write byte.  Ho ho.  Ha ha. Hee hee.)

Follow the same pattern you did with the datasheet; familiarize yourself
with the sections, try to get a sense of what's going on with this
thing.  Reminder that you can keep one window open with the pdf, and one
with your browser aimed at your search engine of choice or wikipedia,
which often is a good reference for this kind of thing. (What the hell
is an ADC?)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Connect to the target. 

Reminder: our target for the purposes of this document is the FR6989
Raunchpad.

Still determined?  Good. Still planning on using muforth?  Peachy.

Ok, read and follow the directions here:

    mu/target/MSP430/HOW-TO/Firmware_Flashing_fr6989.txt

Once you have completed that, unplug your board, replug it, and try the
following:

    mu/target/MSP430/HOW-TO/Firmware_Flashing_fr6989.txt

Once you have completed that, unplug your board, replug it, and try the
following (this assumes you cloned the repo as muforth-anarchitech;
personally when I clone it I name it locally as muap which is a mnemonic
for muforth-anarchitech-public.)

    cd muap/mu
    ./muforth -f target/MSP430/load-fr6989.mu4
    chat
    flash-image
    verify
    lcd-init
    meow

... and take a peek at the LCD.
