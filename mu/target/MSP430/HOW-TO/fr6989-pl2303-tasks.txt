1) flash or reflash the load-chat code:

   ./muforth -d fr6989 -d microscope (optional) -d in-ram \
    -f target/MSP430/load-chat.mu4
   
   chat
   ^C (reset, leave plugged in)

   ./muforth -d fr6989 -d microscope -f target/MSP430/load-chat.mu4
   chat
   flash-image
   verify
   bye (if joy)

2) Connect PL2303 to the FR6989 Launchpad as follows:

   PL2303            FR6989
   GND     -------->  GND
   RX      -------->  P2.0 (outer row header, inline w/ micro usb)
   TX      -------->  P2.1 (opposite header)

3) Plug the FR6989 into one USB port, the PL2303 into another.
   dmesg and note device enumeration of PL2303.  NB: Vast difference
   between OpenBSD & Linux!

   Linux
   
   stty -a < /dev/<pl2303>
   stty raw pass8 115200 < /dev/<pl2303>

   In separate terminal (or terminal window if you're using X)
 
   cat < /dev/<pl2303>

   OpenBSD

   cp mu/target/common/scripts/sermon $HOME/bin
   sermon   ... and follow the directions.  RTFM the code comments in
                sermon first. ;)

4) In your muforth terminal ($HOME/muforth-repo-name/mu)

   ./muforth -d fr6989 -d microscope -f target/MSP430/load-task.mu4
   chat
   flash-image
   verify
   xx (yes, that's a forth word)

5) Tasks are now set up and the timer is (should be) running. Execute
   
   now

   several times in succession and you should see incrementing values on
   the stack.  That's the timer count.  It rolls over after ffff, and it
   increments *quickly*.

   Run the task loop several times and watch your monitoring terminal
   (wherever you're running cat or sermon):

   4000 tt

NB: There is a timeout in ther serial read code of something like 2 to 4
seconds.  It's annoying as fuck in cases like this, because if you try
to pass a value of e000ish or greater to tt, you'll be treated to the
infamous message:

   <key timed out

The solution is 

   rechat

... but it's frequent and annoying enough that I've petitioned daf to
make it a variable that the user can set. We'll see if he bites.
