    msp430: Working chat code for MSP430FR6989!!
    
    I needed to make two changes:
    
    * clear the PM5CTRL bit that holds all i/o pins in high-impedance state
    after reset or upon waking from certain low power modes;
    
    * Fix the "password" written to CSCTL0 to unlock the clock system
    registers. I was using 5a00 and it's supposed to a500. Everything is
    a500 except for the watchdog, which uses 5a00.
    
    To use this code on your FR6989 Launchpad, do the following:
    
      ./muforth -d fr6989 -f target/MSP430/load-chat.mu4 gen-ihex bye > \
              chat-fr6989.hex
    
    (That's all one command line; the \ is just there to demonstrate that
    fact.)
    
    Now you should have a chat-fr6989.hex file in muforth/mu/.
    
    Install MSPFlasher from ti.com if you haven't already. I had to set
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the install directory of MSPFlasher because otherwise
    it couldn't find libmsp430.so. Do what you need to do.
    
    Plug in your Launchpad and run
    
      MSPFlasher -n NO_TARGET
    
    This will update the firmware (if necessary) on the debug bridge on the
    board (ez-FET).
    
    Now flash the chat code into the target:
    
      MSP430Flasher -w chat-fr6989.hex -v -z [VCC]
    
    This will write (-w), verify (-v), and then set the target running.
    
    Now connect using muforth. Make sure that your serial-target symlink in
    muforth/mu/ points to /dev/ttyACM1.
    
      ./muforth -d fr6989 -f target/MSP430/load-chat.mu4
      chat
    
    You should see a banner and some registers!
    
    There are a lot of quirks at this point. I will be working to make the
    experience more seamless and sensible in the near future.
