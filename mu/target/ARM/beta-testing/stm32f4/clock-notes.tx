                             recommended to set a frequency of 2MHz to limit PLL

Notes

ClockTest
to test if clock is connected

use wait-for-rdy
use first line of clock-init

: wait-for-rdy
   begin dup c@ 2 and until drop ;

: clock-init 5 [ RCC_CR 2 + #] wait-for-rdy ;

: clock-test clock-init ; <- syntactic sugar

for 168 MHz you'll need 5 wait states

Always run strings against an image, ya never know.
In the case of the ST's factory .img, you can find the following:

      Joystick in HS mode
      Joystick in FS Mode
