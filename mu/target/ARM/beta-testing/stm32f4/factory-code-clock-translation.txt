       -- HSITRIM is 1_0000b, 10h, 16d 
       -- HSIRDY is ready
       -- HSION is enabled and on (We're using the internal clock, cf
          HSE above)

RCC_PLLCFGR
       -- PLLSRC is 1 which indicates that we are using HSE for PLL!
       -- PLLP division factor is 2 for the main system clock
       -- PLLN multiplication factor for VCO is 240
       -- PLLM division factor for main PLL and audio PLL is 8
       -- PLLQ main division factor of USB OTG FS, SDIO and random
          number generators is 5

RCC_CFGR
       -- SYSCLK has been selected for microcontroller clock output
          (other options include PLLI2S, HSE and PLL. SEE WARNINGS).
       -- No MCO2 Prescaler division is taking place
       -- No MCO1 Prescaler division is taking place
       -- PLLI2S is used as I2S clock source
       -- HSI clock is selected as microcontroller clock output 1.
          **This is the 16MHz internal clock!**
       -- There is no RTC clock enabled (evidenced by no HSE division
          factor)
       -- The APB2 high-speed clock division factor is 2
       -- The APB1 low-speed clock division factor is 4
       -- The System Clock is not divided
       -- The PLL is used as the System Clock(!!!)
           * established by both SWS and SW 2 bit register fields.

RCC_CIR
       -- All bits are 0

RCC_CSR
       -- POR/PDR was reset (likely jtagging)
       -- NRST pin reset occurred
       -- POR/PDR or BOR reset occurred (likely POR/PDR because of above
